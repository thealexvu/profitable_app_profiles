# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For this project, we are data analysts for a company that builds mobile applications for both iOS and Android, with these apps being available on Google Play and the App Store, respectively.

All of the apps that our company builds are free to download and install. The main source of revenue from these apps are in-app ads.

This means that the revenue for any one of the apps is directly correlated to the number of users for that app - the more users who see and engage with the ads, the more revenue each app brings in.

**The goal for this project is to analyze data to help our development team understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.**
